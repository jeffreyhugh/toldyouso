## What Is an Alternate Reality Diary?

An alternate reality diary is not like ordinary journaling.
It is not just a record of daily events.
Instead, it is a collection of messages written today to be discovered much later.
These messages are filled with thoughts, feelings, and hopes locked in time.
You can personalize the timeline for rediscovery maybe five years, or ten years, or even longer.

The difference comes from intention.
In ordinary writing, your message is about immediate memories.
Here, you write for the future as if crafting a letter to another you in a different timeline.
It is as exciting as writing to someone in a parallel universe.

For example, imagine writing to yourself about your current dreams.
You tell your future self something like this:

> Right now, my dream is to start a bakery with my own recipes. By the time you read this message, I hope it has come true.

This makes your words filled with self-reflection and future curiosity.

Parallel universe is a lovely way to think of this diary.
Each message becomes a bridge to a future reality.
When you craft these notes, it feels like you are time traveling through your emotions and thoughts.
Later, you rediscover them as if they are whispers from an alternate version of your life.
It is poetic, is it not?
